## Writing Numbers Using Words

[How to Write Out Numbers Using Words](https://www.thebalance.com/write-numbers-using-words-4083198)
> Writing out numbers can be intimidating. Fortunately, in most situations, you just need to make things clear enough to avoid major confusion and disputes. For example, when writing a check, banks will only reference the words to verify the numerals written elsewhere on the check.

A few examples:

| Input | Output                                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | "zero dollars"                                                  |
| 0.12  | "twelve cents" or "12/100"                                      |
| 10.55 | "ten dollars and fifty five cents" or "ten dollars and 55/100"    |
| 120   | "one hundred twenty dollars"                                    |

### Testing

Read `tests/Treasure/MoneyTest` and run `./vendor/bin/phpunit` to verify it works.
